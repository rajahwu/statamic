Statamic, a flat-file content management system (CMS), offers developers the ability to create custom websites that are both easy to manage and beautiful. And because Statamic is built with PHP on top of Laravel, it is a natural fit for Laravel developers looking for an alternative to WordPress. In this course, join instructor Zuzana Kunckova as she covers the essentials of this versatile, full-featured CMS.

Zuzana steps through how to install Statamic, create users, and add and style content. She also shows how to work with Antlers, the templating engine that comes with Statamic, to fetch and filter content, as well as display and modify data on the front end. Plus, discover how to upload and deploy your very own Statamic website on Netlify, a free hosting service for web applications and static websites.
